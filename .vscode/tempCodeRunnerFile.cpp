1) Write a program to take a number as an input and then reverse the number using functions. 
2) Design a Car class to represent cars available for rent, with attributes like car model, year of manufacture, rent per day, etc. Implement member functions to rent a car, return a car, and display available cars. Create objects of the Car class and perform operations like renting a car, returning a car, and displaying available cars. 
3)Create a Product class to represent products available for purchase online, with attributes like product ID, name, price, etc. Implement member functions to add a product to the cart, remove a product from the cart, and display the contents of the cart. Create objects of the 
Product class and perform operations like adding products to the cart, removing products from the cart, and displaying the contents of the cart. 
4) Write a function using reference variable as argument to swap the values of a pair of integers. 
5)Write a C++ program to print Fibonacci series without using recursion and using recursion implementing the concept of functions in both scenarios call by value and call by function. 
6) Write a C++ program to check if a number is prime or not using call by references method 
7) Write a c++ program to convert number in characters. 
8) Write a c++ program to convert decimal number to binary.
9) Input a character 'R' for red , 'Y' for yellow,  and 'G' for green. Print corresponding action "STOP", "WAIT" and "GO".
10) Input a temperature value and print "Too Cold" if below 10, "Normal" if between 10 and 30 and "Too hot" if above 30.
11) Ask user to enter the total bill amount

        2000-5000 :    10%
        below 2000 :   No discount 
        print the amount
12) Write the output of the program 
# include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void main()
{
int i;
i=400*400/400;
cout<<i;
}
13) Write the output of the program 
# include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void main()
{
int num[]={1,2,3,4,5,6};
num[1]==[1]num? cout<<"Success": cout<<"Error";
}
